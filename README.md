# Various Dotfiles
Because maintaining a coherent configuration across multiple devices is annoying.  
Visuals are configuered to fit with [Sweet KDE](https://store.kde.org/p/1294174/)  
(Set that up on your own, including KDE config files is too much of a hassle.)
## Requirements
* [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
## Usage
* Clone to `~/dotfiles`
* `stow <directory>` to symlink that configuration bundle
* You might have to delete the existing configuration files because Stow will not override.
